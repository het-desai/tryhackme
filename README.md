# TryHackMe Write-ups

Welcome to my TryHackMe (THM) write-ups repository! This repository contains detailed write-ups of the TryHackMe machines, challenges, and labs that I have solved. Each write-up includes a step-by-step guide on how I approached the challenge, the tools I used, and the methods I applied to achieve the final objective.

## Introduction

TryHackMe is an online platform that provides a variety of challenges that cover a wide range of topics in cybersecurity, including penetration testing, reverse engineering, digital forensics, cryptography, and more. The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process and to help others who are also working through these challenges.


Each folder is named after the specific machine or challenge and contains:

- `Write-up.docx` or `Write-up.md` : A detailed write-up of the machine or challenge.
- `screenshots/`: A directory containing screenshots of important steps or results.
- `notes.txt`: Any additional notes or observations that were made during the challenge.
- `exploit.py`: The exploit script used, if applicable.
